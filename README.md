# GH Pages Portfolio

Started this project to learn react router dom and improve my sass.

I plan to host this portfolio on my domain www.kevinsana.com, but for now it will be hosted on the gh-pages domain while I work on this.

### `To view this project:`

visit the gh-pages: https://krownlesskev.github.io/gh-pages-portfolio/ , or clone this git and run npm start.


## `Projects Page is still under development`

I have yet to create the project card component and style it.


## `Skills Page is still under development`

Skills Page Component exists and has a rough layout of how the the skills box will look like.
But it still needs to be styled.
