# GH Pages Portfolio

Started this project to learn react router dom and improve my sass.

I plan to host this portfolio on my domain www.kevinsana.com, but for now it will be hosted on the gh-pages domain while I work on this.

### `To view this project:`

visit the gh-pages , or clone this git and run npm start.
